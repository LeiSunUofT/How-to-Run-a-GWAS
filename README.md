# How to Run a GWAS  (A report of the workshop can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12561-023-09375-9).)

## To build a pipeline, in the summer of 2021, our team designed and offered this (online) workshop to 15 senior high school students from the University of Toronto Schools (UTS) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, selected based on their interests and readiness in statistics, genetics or computing. 

## Throughout the 4.5-day workshop, the mornings were used for lectures, providing the necessary background in genetics and statistics. The afternoons were guided tutorials, providing hands-on experience.  

## The workshop materials provided include
- The detailed hands-on manual and the most updated version is [Open Access](https://github.com/sugolov/GWAS-Workshop) by [Anton Sugolov](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/anton-sugolov?trk=public_profile_browsemap)  and [Eric Emmenegger](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/eric-e-62a57b155?trk=people-guest_people_search-card)
- The lecture notes (1 set) in genetics by [Dr. Andrew Paterson](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/staff/p/andrew-paterson/)
- The lecture notes (5 subsets) in statistics by [Dr. Lei Sun](https://utstat.toronto.edu/sun/).

### The post-workshop survey showed that "Due to the high school background of the students, and the workshop's limited time frame, some found the pace of the lectures to be overwhelming, particularly the statistical section of the lectures." A readme-stat-background file has since been added to explain the challenging levels of the five lecture slide decks.
