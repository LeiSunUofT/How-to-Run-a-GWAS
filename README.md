# How to Run a GWAS

## To build pipeline, in the summer 2021 our team designed and offered this (online) workshop to 17 senior high school students from the University of Toronto Schools (UTS) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, selected based on their interests and readiness in statistics, genetics or computing. 

## Throughout the 4.5-day workshop, the mornings were used for lectures, providing the necessary background in genetics and statistics. The afternoons were guided tutorials, providing hands-on experience.  

## The workshop materials provided include
- The detailed hands-on manual and the most updated version is [openly accessible here](https://github.com/sugolov/GWAS-Workshop), by Anton Sugolov and Eric Emmenegger 
- The lecture notes (1 set) in genetics by [Dr. Andrew Paterson](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/staff/p/andrew-paterson/)
- The lecture notes (6 subsets) in statistics by [Dr. Lei Sun](https://utstat.toronto.edu/sun/).
